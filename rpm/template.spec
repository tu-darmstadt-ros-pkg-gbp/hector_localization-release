%description
hector_pose_estimation_core is the core package of the hector_localization
stack. It contains the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) that estimates the 6DOF pose
of the robot. hector_pose_estimation can be used either as a library, as a
nodelet or as a standalone node.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
