%description
The hector_localization stack is a collection of packages, that provide the full
6DOF pose of a robot or platform. It uses various sensor sources, which are
fused using an Extended Kalman filter. Acceleration and angular rates from an
inertial measurement unit (IMU) serve as primary measurements. The usage of
other sensors is application-dependent. The hector_localization stack currently
supports GPS, magnetometer, barometric pressure sensors and other external
sources that provide a geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovariance message via the
poseupdate topic.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
