%description
message_to_tf translates pose information from different kind of common_msgs
message types to tf. Currently the node supports nav_msgs/Odometry,
geometry_msgs/PoseStamped and sensor_msgs/Imu messages as input. The resulting
transform is divided into three subtransforms with intermediate frames for the
footprint and the stabilized base frame (without roll and pitch).

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
